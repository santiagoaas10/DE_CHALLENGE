The younger sister Xiuli's second son, Ruoxuan, a high school student with excellent character and grades, loses his young life in a car accident; The older sister Xiufang's only daughter Anxin, a young dance teacher, loses both her legs in the car accident. To help her mother overcome her pain, Xiuli's eldest daughter Ruohua brings Xiuli to her student dormitory. However, Xiuli, who is struggling to heal emotionally, still causes huge trouble to Ruohua, a senior who is about to graduate. Especially in her romantic relationship with Zhou Kaize, Ruohua is tortured due to excessive pressure from her mother; Facing her disheartened daughter Anxin and her increasingly fragile and evasive son-in-law Qin Feng, Xiufang, who has always been obese, is determined to inspire confidence in her daughter by achieving an unprecedented weight-loss success. Ruohua is once paranoid about her relationship with her mother, but they eventually get back on the right track and untie the emotional knot between mother and daughter; Xiufang ultimately succeeds in losing weight and accompanies Anxin as she walks out of her marriage and stand up again to face her life.</p>",

The younger sister Xiuli's second son, Ruoxuan, a high school student with excellent character and grades, loses his young life in a car accident; The older sister Xiufang's only daughter Anxin, a young dance teacher, loses both her legs in the car accident. To help her mother overcome her pain, Xiuli's eldest daughter Ruohua brings Xiuli to her student dormitory. However, Xiuli, who is struggling to heal emotionally, still causes huge trouble to Ruohua, a senior who is about to graduate. Especially in her romantic relationship with Zhou Kaize, Ruohua is tortured due to excessive pressure from her mother; Facing her disheartened daughter Anxin and her increasingly fragile and evasive son-in-law Qin Feng, Xiufang, who has always been obese, is determined to inspire confidence in her daughter by achieving an unprecedented weight-loss success. Ruohua is once paranoid about her relationship with her mother, but they eventually get back on the right track and untie the emotional knot between mother and daughter; Xiufang ultimately succeeds in losing weight and accompanies Anxin as she walks out of her marriage and stand up again to face her life.</p>",
