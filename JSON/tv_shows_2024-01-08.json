When Muyun first woke up, he was deliberately bothered by the student Miaoxianyu. Muyun easily completed the Miaoxianyu trap, and he gave more and more alchemy skills by analogy, so the Alchemy masters outside the door could not ask for appreciation. Endless back home, Mu Yun learns that he is about to marry Nona Qin Qin Mengyao. Qin Mengyao was cold and toxic, but could not live until he was 20 years old. The marriage was only for the sake of pastoralists and family of Qin. However, under Mu Linchen's enticement, Mu Yun approves the family's issue on the condition of alchemy.</p><p><br />\u00a0</p>",

Judging their every move is Michelin-trained social media sensation Poppy O'Toole, who is joined by a new judge \u2013 chef, author and YouTube food star Big Has.</p><p>Britain's culinary revolution is hotter than ever, and young enthusiasts hungry for success are paving the way with exciting street dishes, pop-ups and foodie followers on socials.</p><p>Those who are rewriting the rules and stirring up the industry now take another leap into the MasterChef kitchen. Who has what it takes to reach the endgame? The stage is set for the ultimate kitchen battle.</p><p>It's day one of the competition, as all nine of this year's rookie cooks rock up in east London ready to take on the Young MasterChef kitchen. It's all systems go as they face two demanding challenges set by judges Poppy and Big Has. The stakes are high, as the two who fail to make the grade will have their MasterChef adventure cut short.</p><p>First up, the hopefuls get a chance to size up their competition, as they are tasked with cooking their \u2018number one' dish - a plate that shows off personality, has bags of flavour and leaves the judges hungry for more. They will hit the supermarket to buy their own ingredients, but there's a twist! With limited cash, the cooks will have to get creative on a budget. Choosing wisely is key, as the two who stand out from the pack with an original tasty treat will be immune from elimination in the next round, so this is no time to be raiding the ready meal aisle.</p><p>Next up, the skill factor is turned up a notch as the nine cooks are asked to deliver one of the judges' go-to dishes, the perfect plate of pasta, from scratch. Luckily, Big Has is a master with pasta and helps to inspire with a demo of his scrumptious ricotta, parmesan and black pepper ravioli drenched in a sage butter sauce. Who can take instruction and give the Italians a run for their money? Overcooked pasta or a watery sauce just won't cut it.</p><p>With two cooks already safe from elimination, the judges will pick two of the remaining seven for the chopping block. For the others, the Young MasterChef journey will be well and truly underway.</p>",

The hour-long show aired live on evenings every weekday, and was replayed in the overnight/early morning hours. It covered the major news stories of the day with a focus on politics and economics. Field correspondents provided additional reporting and occasionally served as guest anchors. During Dobbs' tenure, notable politicians and economists were often guests on the show, facing his often pointed questioning. On November 11, 2009, Dobbs announced that he would be leaving CNN effective immediately. CNN anchor John King replaced the outgoing Dobbs beginning on March 22, 2010 with his new show <i>John King, USA</i>. Dobbs was eventually hired by Fox Business Network, which re-launched <i>Lou Dobbs Tonight</i> in March 2011.</p>",
