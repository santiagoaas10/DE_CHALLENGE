However, Cheng Yao did not expect to have a housemate, whom she could not get along with. The person turns out to be her new boss, Qian Heng. Qian Heng recruited her into his team, and began his monstrous training. His aim was to chase away Cheng Yao, whom he thought got into the company by relations. Cheng Yao does not know why she landed in this situation, and decides to work harder. She showed great performance in the midst of training, changing Qian Heng's impression toward her. Slowly, they begin to develop feelings for each other, and entered a happy marriage. Cheng Yao also becomes a qualified lawyer.</p>",

The whole academy was in a state of turmoil for a while. Because of the appearance of these two people at the Yiyang academy, they began to have a competition and confrontation with each other. The life of the academy in that era was as full of fresh and interesting stories as the campus life nowadays. Song Zhu unites a group of her best friends and rises up to chase for her own happiness.\u00a0</p>",
