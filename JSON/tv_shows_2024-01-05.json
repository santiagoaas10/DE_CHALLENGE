When Reacher arrives in the small town of Margrave, Georgia, he finds a community grappling with its first homicide in 20 years. The cops immediately arrest him and eyewitnesses claim to place Reacher at the scene of the crime. While he works to prove his innocence, a deep-seated conspiracy begins to emerge, one that will require Reacher's keen mind and hard-hitting fists to deal with. One thing above all is for sure: They picked the wrong guy to take the fall.</p>",

There's no environment like a party to create the perfect recipe for cold blooded murder. Each episode looks beyond the party favors and celebratory atmosphere to get to the bottom of the mysterious death that occurred. Did someone have a motive? Was it an accident? Or was it being in the wrong place at the wrong time? Detectives have their work cut out for them as they piece together the events of the evening from inaccurate witness accounts, cagey party goers, and a chaotic crime scene.</p>",
