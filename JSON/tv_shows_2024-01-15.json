When Muyun first woke up, he was deliberately bothered by the student Miaoxianyu. Muyun easily completed the Miaoxianyu trap, and he gave more and more alchemy skills by analogy, so the Alchemy masters outside the door could not ask for appreciation. Endless back home, Mu Yun learns that he is about to marry Nona Qin Qin Mengyao. Qin Mengyao was cold and toxic, but could not live until he was 20 years old. The marriage was only for the sake of pastoralists and family of Qin. However, under Mu Linchen's enticement, Mu Yun approves the family's issue on the condition of alchemy.</p><p><br />\u00a0</p>",

From a simple and fierce little white criminal policeman, he has grown all the way to a wise and experienced Lanhe County Criminal Police Team Captain. Guan Yu's physical condition went from bad to worse after being promoted to captain of the criminal police. After the 1223 major case, Guan Yu was faced with danger. Under the pressure of time, pressure from superiors, and the loss of relatives and comrades in arms, the black hand of evil is still hidden under the glacier. In the face of this case with many intertwined and implicated cases, can Guan Yu hold high the light of justice and the fire of hope in his hands?</p>",

Providing unparalleled service to wealthy and uncompromising guests is made even more difficult as the team faces everything from love triangles to seeing fellow crew members shockingly cross the line with guests. Voyaging from Santorini, Mykonos, and many of the Greek islands, each episode features a new group of elite clientele who present a new set of challenges, all while offering the crew a glamorous lifestyle and exotic perks that most people only dream of experiencing. For these young, attractive, and adventurous yachties, the \"work hard, play harder\" nature of the job combined with the pressure of working in the most exclusive yachting scene in the world pushes the team close to the breaking point on <b>Below Deck Mediterranean</b>.</p>",
