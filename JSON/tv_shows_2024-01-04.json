Katya does not want her daughter to be sent to an orphanage after her death, and asks Lech to take hold of her head so that he becomes the guardian of an eight-year-old girl. Lech has already lost many close people in his life, so he does everything to help his sister: he gathers old connections and gets a job at the police station. The area turns out to be difficult. The criminals that Lech must catch are fairy\u2014tale characters: Serpent Gorynych, Baba Yaga and other evil spirits. And if the former sniper has no problems catching villains, then trying to become a good guardian becomes a real test for Lehi.</p>",

When Man Zhu experienced the disaster, she suffered a counterattack. Sha Hua saved Man Zhu and thus suffered a natural disaster. Man Zhu ignored the pain of her body and went to save Sha Hua. Sha Hua could not see her sister suffering and decided to sacrifice herself. The god was moved by the emotions of the two sisters and decided to give them a chance to meet when the red magic lily bloomed on the other side. But they agreed to \"not recognize each other\" between meetings. Man Zhu waited again and again, and finally saw Sha Hua, who had lost her memory in the world, but at this time, Sha Hua was already a mortal, named Qian Xia, who was the chief constable of the pure evil department. After the appearance of Man Zhu, there was a legend in the bustling Guangling City. There was a place in the city called the Magic Mirror Pavilion. Its owner was a mysterious woman in red. It is said that as long as you have a wish to realize it, she can help you complete it. The price of realizing the wish is to exchange it with her with your \"one thought\", and Qian Xia was also involved in investigating murders, and embarked on a case investigation journey with the beautiful owner Man Zhu.</p>",

The Avenue of Heaven and Earth is like luck, where the able live. The road to the great road is the road to struggle for the road, which has caused the struggle of all races and souls. An era can only support a few people to gain the Tao. Those who have attained the Tao think that standing on the top of the world, they can be free in the future. But I found that even Dao. It's also hard to escape bad luck. There is a ruler above them, harvesting one era after another, and the cultivators of the world want to maintain their ambitions. Ten thousand races and all spirits are just nourished by these rulers. These masters harvest the Taoists, harvest the spirituality of each world, and destroy one by one. The Taoists in the past were unwilling to be reaped and resisted constantly, but failed every time. Until\u2026 the protagonist Ye Yu appeared, he peeled away one time and one secret. As he unfolded an epic picture scroll, in this magnificent world, he continued to grow, experience love and friendship, cleanse the dusted Taoist heart, and finally confront the master who harvests all races.</p>",

From luxury communities to historic beachfront enclaves, this epic story will follow the brewing feud between the \u2018Brittons' and the \u2018Johnsons,' where the difference between old and new money is very apparent. <b>Carl Weber's The Black Hamptons</b> not only features the glitz and gloss of the Black elite but also exposes the underbelly of wealth and prestige. With a mix of legacy families thriving for generations, friends, wannabes, and thirsty developers, drama can never be too far behind.\u00a0</p>",
