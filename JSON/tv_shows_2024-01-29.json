When Muyun first woke up, he was deliberately bothered by the student Miaoxianyu. Muyun easily completed the Miaoxianyu trap, and he gave more and more alchemy skills by analogy, so the Alchemy masters outside the door could not ask for appreciation. Endless back home, Mu Yun learns that he is about to marry Nona Qin Qin Mengyao. Qin Mengyao was cold and toxic, but could not live until he was 20 years old. The marriage was only for the sake of pastoralists and family of Qin. However, under Mu Linchen's enticement, Mu Yun approves the family's issue on the condition of alchemy.</p><p><br />\u00a0</p>",

The President of the Chamber of Fasci Dino Grandi immediately works with the Duce to have Niccolai freed, who had saved his life on the Carso and who is recognized as a war hero. The captain is released at the behest of Mussolini and, upon returning home, tells Grandi that he was arrested because they wanted to know from him the names of those who were dissatisfied with the Duce in the army. One evening Furio Niccolai, while returning home, was attacked by OVRA agents and thrown into the stairwell, dying instantly. Grandi is worried about the situation and King Vittorio Emanuele III di Savoy suggests him to reunite the Grand Council of Fascism. Grandi takes courage and talks about it with the former President of the Senate Luigi Federzoni, not knowing that he is being monitored by Ruggeri.</p>",

The Americans are getting closer to Rome and Mussolini seems to have lost control of the situation. Grandi, after trying to encourage the King, goes to the Southern Armed Forces Command to convince Umberto II to remove Mussolini by using the army but the Prince quickly liquidates him. Edda Mussolini tries to convince her father of Clara Petacci's bad intentions and of the cheating carried out by her brother Marcello but the Duce does not want to give up his lover and puts her in line.<br /><br />Feltre, 19 July. The harsh discussion between Mussolini and Hitler is interrupted by Giuseppe Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo who announces that Rome has just been bombed and therefore the Duce immediately returns to the capital also ordering that Clara Petacci be banished from Palazzo Venezia. Meanwhile Grandi tries to leverage Maria Jos\u00e8 to help him convince Umberto II to remove the Duce but the princess does not want to support him because he is a fascist. Meanwhile, Mussolini calls the Grand Council because he wants to face the traitors and Grandi is surprised.</p>",

Umberto II discovers that his wife is carrying out peace negotiations on her behalf and scolds her harshly. The Prince, with the Anglo-Americans advancing, then tries to convince his father to oust Mussolini but the King says his hands are tied fearing that the Duce has convened the Grand Council to change the dynastic line of the Savoy. Italo Niccolai, Furio's son, is seen in the company of Beatrice Grandi, Dino's niece. The hierarch forbids his niece from seeing the boy because she has joined the anti-fascists but the young woman is too in love with her and the two continue to see each other in secret. Grandi is approached by Ingrid Eriksson, a Swedish journalist sent by Winston Churchill to test the waters for his possible position as prime minister in Mussolini's place. Grandi and Ciano then make an agreement: for the post-Mussolini period they will act as prime minister and party secretary. Marcello Petacci finds out about it from a man from Ciano and her sister, now unable to notify the Duce directly, sends the news to Edda through Colonel Eugen Dollmann; shortly afterwards Mussolini's daughter notices her husband talking to Grandi but he downplays the matter. Grandi approaches Italo, telling him not to associate with his niece anymore but the boy does not seem to fear him and also challenges him on a political level. Clara Petacci, after being harshly scolded by her mother for having lost Mussolini, attempts to commit suicide.</p>",

Vittorio Ambrosio, Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, reports to the King the harsh discussion that took place between Hitler and Mussolini in Feltre and proposes to stop the Duce but Savoy is not at all convinced and asks Pietro Badoglio for advice who tells him that Mussolini's successor must be one of his most loyal followers. The King receives the Duce and tells him that he will continue to support him. Ciano meets Mario Jos\u00e8 and suggests her not to attempt any risky moves. On the eve of the Grand Council, Grandi is received by Mussolini and advises him to pass the buck but the Duce becomes furious and shouts at him that defeatists like him will be punished. Maria Jos\u00e9 is intercepted while she is talking on the phone with the ambassador to Portugal, Umberto Capodilista, and the King is made aware of it. Grandi decides to send her niece to Cremona to distance her from Italo but despite this the two promise each other eternal love.<br /><br />July 24th. It is the day of the Great Council.

Petacci shows up at Palazzo Venezia while the meeting is in progress and she leaves him a written message. Party secretary Scorza presents another agenda but Grandi opposes it and gets his to be put to the vote: surprisingly, with 19 votes in favor (including that of Ciano), 8 against and 1 abstention, the motion of the President of the party passes Room. After the defeat, Mussolini prepares revenge against the traitors and meets Claretta again. Approached by an emissary of the King, Grandi denies wanting any role in a future government but opposes the possibility that Badoglio could be the Duce's successor. Once he returns home, Grandi discovers that his wife never left and that she has disappeared.<br /><br />July 25th. Mussolini downplays the incident and proposes to arrest all the conspirators who, according to him, undermined the stability of the homeland. The Duce reveals that the Council could change the dynastic line and that many hierarchs would not look kindly on Prince Umberto. The King makes him understand that he has lost on every front and that they will discuss a new government together. At the end of the meeting, however, Mussolini was picked up by the Carabinieri with an excuse and then arrested. Grandi shows up at the OVRA and warns Ruggeri against touching the wife of the future Prime Minister; Antonietta is then freed. Shortly afterwards the King chooses Badoglio as the new Prime Minister, the fascist headquarters are stormed and the Petacci family and the Grandi manage to escape just in time while Beatrice, having returned to Rome after a change of heart, is reunited with Italo.</p>",

All races and spirits have different races and different beliefs, but the same is the extravagant hope for Taoism. Any living beings are dusted with Dao heart, they are not willing to do this, they become powerful and even live forever by enlightening Dao through practice. The Avenue of Heaven and Earth is like luck, where the able live. The road to the great road is the road to struggle for the road, which has caused the struggle of all races and souls. An era can only support a few people to gain the Tao. Those who have attained the Tao think that standing on the top of the world, they can be free in the future. But I found that even Dao. It's also hard to escape bad luck. There is a ruler above them, harvesting one era after another, and the cultivators of the world want to maintain their ambitions. Ten thousand races and all spirits are just nourished by these rulers. These masters harvest the Taoists, harvest the spirituality of each world, and destroy one by one. The Taoists in the past were unwilling to be reaped and resisted constantly, but failed every time. Until\u2026 the protagonist Ye Yu appeared, he peeled away one time and one secret. As he unfolded an epic picture scroll, in this magnificent world, he continued to grow, experience love and friendship, cleanse the dusted Taoist heart, and finally confront the master who harvests all races.</p>",

Due to their disagreement with Qionghua Sect's cultivation philosophy, the disciples of Qionghua Sect Yun Tianqing (played by Baron Chen) and Su Yu left Qionghua and went to Qingluan Peak, where they gave birth to their son Yun Tianhe (played by Chen Zheyuan). Not long after, Su Yu passed away. The young Yun Tianhe is not aware of his parents' past, and his father Yun Tianqing also passes away due to illness, leaving him to grow up alone on the mountain. Yun Tianhe runs into Han Lingsha (played by Ju Jingyi), a young lady who breaks into his parents' tomb, and they go down the mountain together to search for his parents' past. In the midst of their journey, they get acquainted with another lady Liu Mengli (played by Mao Xiaohui). In order to understand his father's past, Yun Tianhe, along with Han Lingsha and Liu Mengli, become disciples of the Kunxu Qionghua Sect. Qionghua Sect assigns Murong Ziying (played by Mao Zijun), who is similar in age, to mentor them, and the four become companions. As his background is gradually revealed, the four of them, who have originally sympathized with each other, are plunged into deep pain and confusion. In the end, Yun Tianhe joins hands with his close friends and embarks on the path of saving the world by resisting his fate.</p>",
