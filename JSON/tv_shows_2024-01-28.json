Due to their disagreement with Qionghua Sect's cultivation philosophy, the disciples of Qionghua Sect Yun Tianqing (played by Baron Chen) and Su Yu left Qionghua and went to Qingluan Peak, where they gave birth to their son Yun Tianhe (played by Chen Zheyuan). Not long after, Su Yu passed away. The young Yun Tianhe is not aware of his parents' past, and his father Yun Tianqing also passes away due to illness, leaving him to grow up alone on the mountain. Yun Tianhe runs into Han Lingsha (played by Ju Jingyi), a young lady who breaks into his parents' tomb, and they go down the mountain together to search for his parents' past. In the midst of their journey, they get acquainted with another lady Liu Mengli (played by Mao Xiaohui). In order to understand his father's past, Yun Tianhe, along with Han Lingsha and Liu Mengli, become disciples of the Kunxu Qionghua Sect. Qionghua Sect assigns Murong Ziying (played by Mao Zijun), who is similar in age, to mentor them, and the four become companions. As his background is gradually revealed, the four of them, who have originally sympathized with each other, are plunged into deep pain and confusion. In the end, Yun Tianhe joins hands with his close friends and embarks on the path of saving the world by resisting his fate.</p>",

                "summary": "<p>19 years ago, Qionghua Sect used the double swords of Wangshu and Xihe to trap the demon realm and seize spiritual power, triggering a war between humans and demons, with heavy casualties on both sides. Due to their disagreement with Qionghua Sect's cultivation philosophy, the disciples of Qionghua Sect Yun Tianqing (played by Baron Chen) and Su Yu left Qionghua and went to Qingluan Peak, where they gave birth to their son Yun Tianhe (played by Chen Zheyuan). Not long after, Su Yu passed away. The young Yun Tianhe is not aware of his parents' past, and his father Yun Tianqing also passes away due to illness, leaving him to grow up alone on the mountain. Yun Tianhe runs into Han Lingsha (played by Ju Jingyi), a young lady who breaks into his parents' tomb, and they go down the mountain together to search for his parents' past. In the midst of their journey, they get acquainted with another lady Liu Mengli (played by Mao Xiaohui). In order to understand his father's past, Yun Tianhe, along with Han Lingsha and Liu Mengli, become disciples of the Kunxu Qionghua Sect. Qionghua Sect assigns Murong Ziying (played by Mao Zijun), who is similar in age, to mentor them, and the four become companions. As his background is gradually revealed, the four of them, who have originally sympathized with each other, are plunged into deep pain and confusion. In the end, Yun Tianhe joins hands with his close friends and embarks on the path of saving the world by resisting his fate.</p>",
