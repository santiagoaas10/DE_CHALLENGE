The seemingly insignificant find awakens the memory of Kai, Maggie's missing brother, in Roland Voit and Maggie Kring. Kai was an extraordinary, mysterious boy. Maggie simply cannot and does not want to believe that he is no longer alive and now hopes to have found proof of this. She asks Adrian Demko for support. Adrian has been in a wheelchair since a terrible accident in her youth, in which an unexploded bomb from the Second World War exploded. He instructs his carer Marek Gorski to accompany Maggie on a trip across the border to Poland. The trail leads the two to a mysterious building in the border area - there an assassination attempt is carried out on Maggie.</p>",

Reacher is a drifter, carrying no phone and the barest of essentials as he travels the country and explores the nation he once served. When Reacher arrives in the small town of Margrave, Georgia, he finds a community grappling with its first homicide in 20 years. The cops immediately arrest him and eyewitnesses claim to place Reacher at the scene of the crime. While he works to prove his innocence, a deep-seated conspiracy begins to emerge, one that will require Reacher's keen mind and hard-hitting fists to deal with. One thing above all is for sure: They picked the wrong guy to take the fall.</p>",

The younger sister Xiuli's second son, Ruoxuan, a high school student with excellent character and grades, loses his young life in a car accident; The older sister Xiufang's only daughter Anxin, a young dance teacher, loses both her legs in the car accident. To help her mother overcome her pain, Xiuli's eldest daughter Ruohua brings Xiuli to her student dormitory. However, Xiuli, who is struggling to heal emotionally, still causes huge trouble to Ruohua, a senior who is about to graduate. Especially in her romantic relationship with Zhou Kaize, Ruohua is tortured due to excessive pressure from her mother; Facing her disheartened daughter Anxin and her increasingly fragile and evasive son-in-law Qin Feng, Xiufang, who has always been obese, is determined to inspire confidence in her daughter by achieving an unprecedented weight-loss success. Ruohua is once paranoid about her relationship with her mother, but they eventually get back on the right track and untie the emotional knot between mother and daughter; Xiufang ultimately succeeds in losing weight and accompanies Anxin as she walks out of her marriage and stand up again to face her life.</p>",

The younger sister Xiuli's second son, Ruoxuan, a high school student with excellent character and grades, loses his young life in a car accident; The older sister Xiufang's only daughter Anxin, a young dance teacher, loses both her legs in the car accident. To help her mother overcome her pain, Xiuli's eldest daughter Ruohua brings Xiuli to her student dormitory. However, Xiuli, who is struggling to heal emotionally, still causes huge trouble to Ruohua, a senior who is about to graduate. Especially in her romantic relationship with Zhou Kaize, Ruohua is tortured due to excessive pressure from her mother; Facing her disheartened daughter Anxin and her increasingly fragile and evasive son-in-law Qin Feng, Xiufang, who has always been obese, is determined to inspire confidence in her daughter by achieving an unprecedented weight-loss success. Ruohua is once paranoid about her relationship with her mother, but they eventually get back on the right track and untie the emotional knot between mother and daughter; Xiufang ultimately succeeds in losing weight and accompanies Anxin as she walks out of her marriage and stand up again to face her life.</p>",
