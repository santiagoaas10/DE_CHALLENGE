However, Cheng Yao did not expect to have a housemate, whom she could not get along with. The person turns out to be her new boss, Qian Heng. Qian Heng recruited her into his team, and began his monstrous training. His aim was to chase away Cheng Yao, whom he thought got into the company by relations. Cheng Yao does not know why she landed in this situation, and decides to work harder. She showed great performance in the midst of training, changing Qian Heng's impression toward her. Slowly, they begin to develop feelings for each other, and entered a happy marriage. Cheng Yao also becomes a qualified lawyer.</p>",

The rituals, costumes, and texts of carols vary not only between regions, but sometimes even within the same village. In Soviet times, the church, and thus all these holidays, were banned. Carolers and malanka players were detained for performing ritual songs. As a result, in most regions of Ukraine, the authentic tradition of celebration was interrupted for several decades. Today, it is gradually reviving or continuing in places where Soviet bans could not fully reach. Watch our documentary series to see how we have seen Christmas and Malanka in different regions of Ukraine over the years.</p>",
