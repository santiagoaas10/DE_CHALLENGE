At her wit's end, several individuals meet at the Li residence: the noble young creditor Shangguan Guchuan, the scholar Fan Zhongju who's in the capital to take the imperial exams and looking for accommodation, and the young man Liu Lang who comes to repay his debt of gratitude to Li Tiandi. With her father gone and the debts outstanding, Xie Quanjia, while dealing with the pressing creditor, decides to let these men settle in the mansion and rent empty rooms to a princess from the Western Regions and her servant fleeing from an arranged marriage, along with Guo Dongli, a restaurant manager, to alleviate the debt burden. From then on, while living together, each individual dedicates their energy to carving out their own success in Changle.

They also cover allegations that UN employees in Gaza participated in the October 7th Hamas attack, the International Court of Justice's ruling about genocide charges against Israel, and Nancy Pelosi's odd criticism of activists calling for a ceasefire. They also discuss NATO member fears about Russia, Trump floating major tariffs on China, a Kenyan court blocking the\u00a0deployment of police to Haiti, and French farmers laying siege to Paris. Then, Tommy speaks with Ali Vaez, Iran Project Director at the International Crisis Group, about Iranian proxy groups, why Iran funds them, and the US conventional wisdom that Iran can only be deterred through military action.</p>",

It was a crash course that taught him two things: anyone can understand these issues, and we all have an obligation to try. That's why he started Pod Save the World\u2014a weekly podcast that breaks down international news and foreign policy developments, but doesn't feel like homework. Each week, he and former deputy national security advisor and co-host Ben Rhodes walk you through the latest developments with a variety of experts and take you behind the scenes of big decisions with the people who were there. Count on hearing stories from the White House Situation Room, funny anecdotes, and maybe a few F bombs along the way.</p>",

Due to their disagreement with Qionghua Sect's cultivation philosophy, the disciples of Qionghua Sect Yun Tianqing (played by Baron Chen) and Su Yu left Qionghua and went to Qingluan Peak, where they gave birth to their son Yun Tianhe (played by Chen Zheyuan). Not long after, Su Yu passed away. The young Yun Tianhe is not aware of his parents' past, and his father Yun Tianqing also passes away due to illness, leaving him to grow up alone on the mountain. Yun Tianhe runs into Han Lingsha (played by Ju Jingyi), a young lady who breaks into his parents' tomb, and they go down the mountain together to search for his parents' past. In the midst of their journey, they get acquainted with another lady Liu Mengli (played by Mao Xiaohui). In order to understand his father's past, Yun Tianhe, along with Han Lingsha and Liu Mengli, become disciples of the Kunxu Qionghua Sect. Qionghua Sect assigns Murong Ziying (played by Mao Zijun), who is similar in age, to mentor them, and the four become companions. As his background is gradually revealed, the four of them, who have originally sympathized with each other, are plunged into deep pain and confusion. In the end, Yun Tianhe joins hands with his close friends and embarks on the path of saving the world by resisting his fate.</p>",

Amai (Zhang Tianai), the daughter of the Duke of Jingguo in Southern Xia, witnesses her entire family being killed by her childhood friend Chen Qi. Years later, Amai, now a young girl, disguises herself as a man and roams the martial world, seeking revenge against Chen Qi. Through a series of coincidences, Amai saves Shang Yizhi (Zhang Haowei), the son of the Grand Princess, and subsequently helps him escape from dangerous situations multiple times, intertwining their destinies. As war breaks out, Amai sheds her feminine attire and joins the military, becoming an infantry soldier. With her exceptional military talents, she achieves remarkable feats and rises to the rank of General Mai. Alongside this, she assists Shang Yizhi, who is hunted and faces difficulties, in finding his true self and accomplishing great deeds. On the battlefield, Amai repeatedly clashes with General Chang Yuqing (Wang Ruichang) from the enemy forces. Despite their confrontations, they unintentionally go through life-and-death situations together, developing a mutual understanding and respect. However, faced with the brutality of war, Amai willingly sets aside personal attachments and uses her youth and fervor to defend her army. Eventually, after the war's victory, Amai leaves the military, returns to her female identity, retreats from the world, and ultimately finds her own happiness.</p>",

                "summary": "<p>The story follows Amai, a female general of the founding era of the Southern Xia dynasty, who discards her feminine attire and dons battle armor, enduring hardships to become a legendary female warrior. Amai (Zhang Tianai), the daughter of the Duke of Jingguo in Southern Xia, witnesses her entire family being killed by her childhood friend Chen Qi. Years later, Amai, now a young girl, disguises herself as a man and roams the martial world, seeking revenge against Chen Qi. Through a series of coincidences, Amai saves Shang Yizhi (Zhang Haowei), the son of the Grand Princess, and subsequently helps him escape from dangerous situations multiple times, intertwining their destinies. As war breaks out, Amai sheds her feminine attire and joins the military, becoming an infantry soldier. With her exceptional military talents, she achieves remarkable feats and rises to the rank of General Mai. Alongside this, she assists Shang Yizhi, who is hunted and faces difficulties, in finding his true self and accomplishing great deeds. On the battlefield, Amai repeatedly clashes with General Chang Yuqing (Wang Ruichang) from the enemy forces. Despite their confrontations, they unintentionally go through life-and-death situations together, developing a mutual understanding and respect. However, faced with the brutality of war, Amai willingly sets aside personal attachments and uses her youth and fervor to defend her army. Eventually, after the war's victory, Amai leaves the military, returns to her female identity, retreats from the world, and ultimately finds her own happiness.</p>",
