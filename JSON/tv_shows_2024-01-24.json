Huang Yingzi went to Beijing for school and Jiang Yi left for the States. \"Who do you like at the age of seventeen\" has become a mystery lingering in the hearts of the seven people. As newcomers in the workplace, they were bruised and battered from the skirmishes between their ideals and reality. Their once pure emotions are like shining stars in the night sky. Huang Yingzi wants to reunite the group only to realize that there a question remains. Meanwhile, Jiang Yi and the others have already been presented their answer.</p>",

That's why he started Pod Save the World\u2014a weekly podcast that breaks down international news and foreign policy developments, but doesn't feel like homework. Each week, he and former deputy national security advisor and co-host Ben Rhodes walk you through the latest developments with a variety of experts and take you behind the scenes of big decisions with the people who were there. Count on hearing stories from the White House Situation Room, funny anecdotes, and maybe a few F bombs along the way.</p>",
