However, she soon discovers that instead of inheriting vast fortunes, she has been left with massive debts. At her wit's end, several individuals meet at the Li residence: the noble young creditor Shangguan Guchuan, the scholar Fan Zhongju who's in the capital to take the imperial exams and looking for accommodation, and the young man Liu Lang who comes to repay his debt of gratitude to Li Tiandi. With her father gone and the debts outstanding, Xie Quanjia, while dealing with the pressing creditor, decides to let these men settle in the mansion and rent empty rooms to a princess from the Western Regions and her servant fleeing from an arranged marriage, along with Guo Dongli, a restaurant manager, to alleviate the debt burden. From then on, while living together, each individual dedicates their energy to carving out their own success in Changle. Amidst the chaotic pursuit of their dreams and handling the constant flow of visitors to the mansion, they lead lives filled with unrest yet are ultimately joyful.</p>",

However, she soon discovers that instead of inheriting vast fortunes, she has been left with massive debts. At her wit's end, several individuals meet at the Li residence: the noble young creditor Shangguan Guchuan, the scholar Fan Zhongju who's in the capital to take the imperial exams and looking for accommodation, and the young man Liu Lang who comes to repay his debt of gratitude to Li Tiandi. With her father gone and the debts outstanding, Xie Quanjia, while dealing with the pressing creditor, decides to let these men settle in the mansion and rent empty rooms to a princess from the Western Regions and her servant fleeing from an arranged marriage, along with Guo Dongli, a restaurant manager, to alleviate the debt burden. From then on, while living together, each individual dedicates their energy to carving out their own success in Changle. Amidst the chaotic pursuit of their dreams and handling the constant flow of visitors to the mansion, they lead lives filled with unrest yet are ultimately joyful.</p>",

She falls in love at first sight with Immortal Lord Mo Chenyuan and forces him back to the demon realm to marry her. Mo Chenyuan has always had a crush on Feng Ruoyao. Since he has been seriously injured by his half-brother in secret, he turns Feng Ruoyao's trick to his own use and allows himself to be captured by her in order to recuperate in the demon realm. The two seem to be quarrelsome foes, but in fact, their love is two-way. No matter what obstacles they encounter, they always treat each other with sincerity. Eventually, they manage to eliminate the gap between the immortal and the demon and get together...</p>",

Due to their disagreement with Qionghua Sect's cultivation philosophy, the disciples of Qionghua Sect Yun Tianqing (played by Baron Chen) and Su Yu left Qionghua and went to Qingluan Peak, where they gave birth to their son Yun Tianhe (played by Chen Zheyuan). Not long after, Su Yu passed away. The young Yun Tianhe is not aware of his parents' past, and his father Yun Tianqing also passes away due to illness, leaving him to grow up alone on the mountain. Yun Tianhe runs into Han Lingsha (played by Ju Jingyi), a young lady who breaks into his parents' tomb, and they go down the mountain together to search for his parents' past. In the midst of their journey, they get acquainted with another lady Liu Mengli (played by Mao Xiaohui). In order to understand his father's past, Yun Tianhe, along with Han Lingsha and Liu Mengli, become disciples of the Kunxu Qionghua Sect. Qionghua Sect assigns Murong Ziying (played by Mao Zijun), who is similar in age, to mentor them, and the four become companions. As his background is gradually revealed, the four of them, who have originally sympathized with each other, are plunged into deep pain and confusion. In the end, Yun Tianhe joins hands with his close friends and embarks on the path of saving the world by resisting his fate.</p>",

                "summary": "<p>19 years ago, Qionghua Sect used the double swords of Wangshu and Xihe to trap the demon realm and seize spiritual power, triggering a war between humans and demons, with heavy casualties on both sides. Due to their disagreement with Qionghua Sect's cultivation philosophy, the disciples of Qionghua Sect Yun Tianqing (played by Baron Chen) and Su Yu left Qionghua and went to Qingluan Peak, where they gave birth to their son Yun Tianhe (played by Chen Zheyuan). Not long after, Su Yu passed away. The young Yun Tianhe is not aware of his parents' past, and his father Yun Tianqing also passes away due to illness, leaving him to grow up alone on the mountain. Yun Tianhe runs into Han Lingsha (played by Ju Jingyi), a young lady who breaks into his parents' tomb, and they go down the mountain together to search for his parents' past. In the midst of their journey, they get acquainted with another lady Liu Mengli (played by Mao Xiaohui). In order to understand his father's past, Yun Tianhe, along with Han Lingsha and Liu Mengli, become disciples of the Kunxu Qionghua Sect. Qionghua Sect assigns Murong Ziying (played by Mao Zijun), who is similar in age, to mentor them, and the four become companions. As his background is gradually revealed, the four of them, who have originally sympathized with each other, are plunged into deep pain and confusion. In the end, Yun Tianhe joins hands with his close friends and embarks on the path of saving the world by resisting his fate.</p>",
