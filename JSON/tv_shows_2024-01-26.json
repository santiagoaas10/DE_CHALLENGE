When Muyun first woke up, he was deliberately bothered by the student Miaoxianyu. Muyun easily completed the Miaoxianyu trap, and he gave more and more alchemy skills by analogy, so the Alchemy masters outside the door could not ask for appreciation. Endless back home, Mu Yun learns that he is about to marry Nona Qin Qin Mengyao. Qin Mengyao was cold and toxic, but could not live until he was 20 years old. The marriage was only for the sake of pastoralists and family of Qin. However, under Mu Linchen's enticement, Mu Yun approves the family's issue on the condition of alchemy.</p><p><br />\u00a0</p>",

Amelia's dry humour has the ability to disarm the media trained front of her musical guests to provide the audience with a show that presents grime/uk rap culture as it is rarely seen. Above all, <i>Chicken Shop Date</i> proves that whoever said romance is dead has never been on a date to Chicken Cottage.</p>",

There's no environment like a party to create the perfect recipe for cold blooded murder. Each episode looks beyond the party favors and celebratory atmosphere to get to the bottom of the mysterious death that occurred. Did someone have a motive? Was it an accident? Or was it being in the wrong place at the wrong time? Detectives have their work cut out for them as they piece together the events of the evening from inaccurate witness accounts, cagey party goers, and a chaotic crime scene.</p>",
